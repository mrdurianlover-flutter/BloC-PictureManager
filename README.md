a mobile application and a server which takes and stores pictures. It allow the user to perform a variety of actions on the database.

## Technology used

Our Application is written in Dart using Flutter to work on mobile platforms. The advantages of using Flutter are that we can target both Android and iOS. Dart is simpler, more flexible. Flutter also has many different libraries which can be used to boost development, and are very easy to install and use in a project. Furthermore, we wanted to discover Cross Platform development, as we have a background in native app development.
